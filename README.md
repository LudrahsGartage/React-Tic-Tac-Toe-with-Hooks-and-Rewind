# React Tic Tac Toe with Hooks and Rewind

A react app to play tic tac toe.

We store states for the history of moves, current move number and current player.
The game component passes the handle click function as a prop and when it is called by a square, it rerenders the app and calculates the winner at each render.
The current player state is flipped at end of each move.
The entire history is managed by arrays of 9 elements. When the uses clicks on go to step count, we use the current step count as the indice of array and render the board from that point onwards.

Made along with Scrimba's React course.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
